# 📘 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for a web-based women healthcare application that enables users to track symptoms, perform AI-based health risk detection using images and structured data, and receive recommended follow-up medical tests for early intervention.

### 1.2 Scope

The system will provide early-stage screening for common women health disorders such as anemia, PCOS, and thyroid imbalance using symptom input and image analysis. It is not a diagnostic tool but a **decision-support system** that encourages timely medical consultation.

### 1.3 Target Users

- Women aged 15–45
- Students, working professionals, and homemakers
- Users with smartphones or web access

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The application is a standalone web-based system with a frontend interface, backend services, AI processing module, and database.

### 2.2 Product Functions (High-Level)

- Collect user symptoms
- Accept medical-related images
- Predict possible health risk
- Suggest medical tests based on detected risk
- Store historical records

### 2.3 Operating Environment

- Frontend: Web Browser
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- AI Engine: Python
- Database: MongoDB
- Image Processing: OpenCV

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Symptom Tracker Module

**FR-1**: The system shall allow users to create a symptom profile.

**FR-2**: The system shall allow users to select symptoms from a predefined list.

**FR-3**: The system shall allow users to enter severity level (Low, Medium, High).

**FR-4**: The system shall store symptom history with timestamps once in a day.

**FR-5**: The system shall allow users to edit or delete symptoms.

FR-6: The system should ask questions related to the specific symptoms

**Example Symptoms:**

- Fatigue
- Hair loss
- Irregular periods
- Weight gain
- Acne
- Cold intolerance

---

### 3.2 AI Risk Detection Module

**FR-6**: The system shall allow users to upload images (face, nails, eyes).

**FR-7**: The system shall preprocess images using OpenCV.

**FR-8**: The system shall extract features from images.

**FR-9**: The system shall combine image features with symptom data.

**FR-10**: The system shall predict risk level (Low, Medium, High).

**FR-11**: The system shall display predicted condition and confidence score.

**FR-12**: The system shall store prediction results.

**FR-13**: The system shall determine whether follow-up medical tests are required.

**FR-14**: The system shall display recommended medical tests along with the prediction results.

**FR-15**: The system shall store all prediction results and test recommendations in user history.

**Example Output:**

```
Possible Condition:AnemiaRisk Level:MediumConfidence:72%
```

---

### 3.3 Follow-Up Medical Test Suggestion Module

**FR-13**: The system shall map detected risks to recommended medical tests.

**FR-14**: The system shall display a list of tests for each condition.

**FR-15**: The system shall explain why each test is suggested.

**FR-16**: The system shall store test suggestions in user history.

**Example Mapping:**

| Condition | Suggested Tests |
| --- | --- |
| Anemia | CBC, Hemoglobin |
| PCOS | Pelvic Ultrasound, LH, FSH |
| Thyroid Disorder | TSH, T3, T4 |
